# Design 

## Colour Scheme 

![colour-pallete](/assets/docs/COLOORS.png)


## Typography

I used the font 'Noto Serif' for this website as it is a sans-serif font which is known for its readability, I also used this font as I feel like it gave the brand a well established theme.

## Imagery

Images used on Stu's Gardening website are all from unsplash.com 

## Wireframes

The site was designed on Balsamiq with desktop and mobile in mind and was later optimized to fit tablets also. Here are the original wireframes:

# Features

## General Features

The website is comprised of a home page, 1 page of prices and a contact page. 

On these pages the features are: 
- a navigation bar
- images that display the companies services
- social media links that are accessible by clicking the relevant icons 
- a form to submit details for money off services
- a map with location of the company

## **The home page**

The home page has a brief history of Stu's Gardening and images above showing the kind of work the company does. It also has a form to sign up to the companies mailing list.

## **The Prices Page**

The prices page has 3 tables of jobs that allows users to see what the starting price of the job they need doing is.

## **Contact**

The contact page shows a map of the shop and also has a telephone number and address for the customer if they need to visit the business in person. 

# Accessibility

I have been mindful whilst coding to ensure the website is accessible. This has been achieved by:
- Using semantic HTML
- Using sans-serif fonts for the site (These are easy-to-read fonts for people with dyslexia and learning difficulties)
- Using larger than default fonts for readability
- Adding alt text to images for users that are using a screen reader
